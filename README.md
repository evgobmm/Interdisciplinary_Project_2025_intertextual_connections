# Interdisciplinary Project 2025: Intertextual Connections

This repository contains materials and code used in the study **“Utilizing Large Language Models to Identify Non-Trivial Intertextual Connections in Literary Texts.”**

## Contents

1. **Data/**  
   - **99_texts.xlsx**: Contains the corpus of 99 short Russian literary texts (including one control text).

2. **Article Proofs/**  
   - **Article_Original_RU.pdf**: The article’s finalized text in Russian (PDF format).  
   - **Article_Translation_EN.md**: The English translation in Markdown form.  


3. **Code for Searching Connections/**  
   - Contains a subset of Python scripts used to:
     1. Read the corpus from `99_texts.xlsx`.
     2. Generate prompts for the Large Language Model (LLM).
     3. Execute batch requests (via OpenAI API) to discover potential intertextual connections.
     4. Collect and log the model’s responses.



If you have any questions or feedback about the methodology, results feel free to contact me directly.
