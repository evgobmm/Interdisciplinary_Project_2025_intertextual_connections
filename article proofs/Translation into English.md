## SEARCHING FOR INTERTEXTUAL CONNECTIONS USING AN LLM  
### New opportunities

On November 30, 2022, OpenAI released the ChatGPT application. Thousands of applications come out every day, but the launch of ChatGPT became something of a milestone, after which artificial neural networks (or, more precisely, “Large Language Models” — GPT-type LLMs) entered the lives of millions of people. And they changed those lives. Perhaps for specialists, that day was not particularly remarkable. It had been a long time in the making, and it was expected. But de facto, after November 30, a new epoch arrived: the LLM GPT-3.5 began speaking to humans in human language.

The article by philologist and mathematician Evgeny Obukhov is devoted to one specific application of LLMs. Literature is a coherent context where all objects (literary works) reference one another. And an LLM is capable of seeing those connections. Possibly, it may require additional training, as in Obukhov’s experiment. The model’s discovered intertextual connections are interesting in various ways, but this is just a trial model that worked on a relatively small body of material, and even on this volume, it noticed a lot.

In my view, neural networks can radically change not only the search for intertexts but many other areas of literary studies. Until now, even the most wide-ranging serious philologists have tended to focus on a particular topic. A person simply cannot cover the entire field of literature. Therefore, we are forced to work with a fairly limited set of “masterpieces” (or “canon”) that have survived in the “cultural archive.” Time filters the material, leaving us only what remains.

Today, that approach seems insufficient—not because we, using an LLM, will discover eternal masterpieces from the past or from some obscure digital resources. Such discoveries are possible, but not very likely. However, with the help of neural-network applications, we can see connections and highlight characteristics that are not visible without such applications: a neural network can find what we had no idea to look for, because we did not know that one could or should ask about it.

Using neural-network tools, we can take a fresh approach, for example, to the problem of literary evolution. Tynyanov suggested that the birth of a masterpiece is primarily influenced by “secondary genres.” But the difficulty is that “secondary literature” is vast, and we do not know why it was one particular work, rather than another, that influenced a genius; we generally search among works that, for one reason or another, have remained in “operational memory,” while we cannot get through to enormous cultural strata.




The article by Evgeny Obukhov suggests trying to search along those paths where no one has walked yet, but where an LLM can lead us. It is not guaranteed that only treasures lie there, but treasures certainly do lie there.


**Vladimir Gubailovsky**


Evgeny Yakovlevich Obukhov was born in 1989 in Odesa. He graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Lomonosov Moscow State University. He holds a Candidate of Philological Sciences degree. He has published (co-authored with Sergei Gorbushin) in the journal *Voprosy Literatury* (*Questions of Literature*). He is (co-)author, together with Sergei Gorbushin, of the books *Udivit’ storozha. Perechityvaya Kharmsa* (*Astonish the Watchman. Rereading Kharms*, Moscow, 2012) and *Perechen’ zverey. Perechityvaya Kharmsa* (*A List of Beasts. Rereading Kharms*, Moscow, 2017). He is author of the book *Haneke* (2024). He is a regular contributor to *Novy Mir* (*New World*). He lives in Vienna.



Let’s begin with a motivating example. In Daniil Kharms’ *Sonnet*, there are memorable lines: “How astonished they were, and how astonished I was, when they suddenly discovered that they, too, could not remember the order of counting. They remember 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, but everything past that they’d forgotten.” And here is a fragment from Jaroslav Hašek’s famous novel *The Good Soldier Švejk*: “They ordered that orderly to look after the lunatic, who spent his entire blessed day doing nothing but sitting in a corner and counting: ‘One, two, three, four, five, six,’ and again: ‘One, two, three, four, five, six.’ He was some kind of professor. The orderly nearly burst with rage, seeing that the madman couldn’t get past six.” People interested in literary studies know that a great deal of attention is paid to intertextual links. Kharms scholarship is no exception; practically everything under the sun is mentioned in connection with this author. But I was unable to find this particular comparison with *Švejk* in any monograph on Kharms or in the main article on *Sonnet*, nor via search engines—both general and for scholarly literature. And that’s taking into account two important circumstances: we are talking about texts that are extremely well known in the Russian-speaking world (anyone who wants to get an idea of Kharms’ prose is sure to read the collection *Sluchai*, *Incidents*, where *Sonnet* is almost at the very beginning, and Hašek’s novel belongs to the unofficial list of must-read classics), and it is a very precise, yet at the same time non-trivial, connection—one that, in my view, is far more substantial and productive than many other comparisons.

It is possible that I simply failed to find a corresponding mention (there is a whole separate serious topic—modern information searching, which in reality is much worse than it might be, given the technologies available). But here I am interested not in this concrete example, but in the essence of the phenomenon. If we attach such importance to intertextual links, it seems odd not to use the tools we do have for searching for them. Before the advent of powerful computers, a researcher could discover a link only thanks to their skills and erudition, as well as by reading articles and talking with colleagues. But for quite some time now, we have had instruments for searching out certain intertextual connections using methods of so-called natural language processing (NLP). The problem is that, despite continuous progress, these methods still have very significant limitations, and they are quite difficult to use. However, the emergence of widely accessible, astonishingly advanced large language models (LLMs, a well-known example is ChatGPT, which reached its first million users in just five days) opened up revolutionary new possibilities for such a search. The point is that (put very simply), previous methods were algorithmic in one way or another—that is, a human being had to devise these algorithms—whereas large language models themselves generate conversation in (one or another) language, imitating a huge number of texts on which they were trained; that is, to some extent they can generate speech like people do, following roughly the same laws (but so far without intentions or self-awareness). Defining precisely what constitutes a “non-trivial intertextual connection” appears, at this time, insoluble, but it is possible to give a rough explanation of what it is. And for a language model, that is sufficient! Even now, it can find high-level connections that either would not be found at all by other computational methods or would require specifically tuning an algorithm for that particular type of connection (and there are very many such local types). Moreover, it can carry out an effective filter, so as not to produce (in large quantities) connections we don’t need. I want to talk about that here.

Progress in the field of language models is now moving extraordinarily quickly. What a leading model fails at today may be no problem at all for the new version just a month from now. For exactly that reason, there will be few technical details or quotations of the model’s replies here. We will focus only on those connections the model managed to find. Newer versions will only get better, so these results will not become outdated. At the same time, we will deliberately not reflect here on the connections that the model failed to find. As already mentioned, progress is so swift that for non-specialists it is rather meaningless to ponder what the model “cannot” do. Even the capabilities we have now are so extensive that it’s enough simply to keep up with them.

To search for connections, I compiled a corpus of 98 short texts (with an upper limit of about 10,000 characters with spaces; the complete list is provided in footnote[^1]). The corpus turned out to be both random and not so random. It is not completely random in the sense that it deliberately includes the most famous Russian-language authors of various periods, often (though not always) with their most famous short stories selected. The corpus is random in the sense that, in compiling it, I intentionally tried not to think about how these texts might be linked to one another; I had either mostly forgotten or never read the majority of the stories, and my selection of lesser-known authors and their texts was also largely arbitrary.

I will now present, in my view, the most interesting connections the model was able to find[^2]. I will limit myself to brief comments—the goal here is not (or not yet) to conduct literary analyses, but to show the grand technological possibilities (and specialists in corresponding fields can comprehend the potential of these connections much better than I can). When evaluating the quality of the model’s finds, it is important to remember that it was not told anything about either the author or the title of a text[^3].

[^2]: I used the `o1-preview` model from OpenAI. Each request (in Russian) began with a prompt (for better readability here, it is shortened and edited): “Please find any ‘non-trivial’ intertextual connections in the texts below. ‘Non-trivial’ means they are specific, non-banal, striking, as if one author had rewritten from another; they must appear unique. These have to be truly non-trivial connections; they may or may not exist in these texts. … You should only very clearly, with details (matching or very similar words, images, situations), show what the connection is. If there are identical or similar words, provide the corresponding quotations. If the connection is more general, please define exactly in what way. Once again, this connection must be so close, non-trivial, and non-banal that typically there aren’t such connections between texts by different authors. If the same connection can be drawn with many other texts the model knows, that connection is considered trivial and should not be provided here. For each connection, also specify a ‘level of presumed intentionality’ (from 0 to 100). If such a connection could have occurred by chance for the authors, the value should be close to 0 (if such motifs are quite common in literature). If, however, the details match so well and are themselves sufficiently specific that, in all likelihood, one author had the other’s text in mind, the value should be nearer to 100. Don’t make anything up and double-check. You are forbidden to use any links or references to authors, their well-known works, quotes, or philosophical ideas if they are not directly present in the text. The connections must be derived strictly from the content of these given texts. If there isn’t a single truly non-trivial, non-accidental connection, please write that there aren’t any.” Then 9 texts followed. It was clearly indicated where one text ended and the next began, but for greater experimental purity, no text titles or authors were indicated. In total, 143 such requests to the model were needed (9 texts in each) so that any pair from the 99 texts would be presented at least once (see Steiner system theory). (The ninety-ninth text, artificially generated with contrived connections, was a control.)  

[^3]: In many cases, we cannot distinguish where the model is “reasoning” on its own versus where it is in fact repeating something previously written in texts it was trained on. However, based on my impressions formed by nearly two years of near-daily experience, in this study the model primarily used the “skills” it had acquired, rather than memorized “knowledge.”

---

A fairly non-trivial connection is found between the main heroine of Ulitskaya’s “Bednye rodsvenniki” (*Poor Relations*) and *A Demonic Woman* by Teffi. The model directs attention to the following quotations: “Asya turned her respectable clothing into the rags of a madwoman. The black ribbons Asya had sewn on in some places fell off and formed loops and bows, and all of it resembled a clever masquerade costume of a musical notebook” (*Poor Relations*). And here is a quote from Teffi’s story: “A demonic woman differs from the ordinary woman primarily by her manner of dressing. … She also wears ordinary items from a lady’s wardrobe, but not in the places they’re supposed to be worn. Thus, for example, a demonic woman might wear a belt only on her head, a single earring on her forehead or on her neck, a ring on her thumb, a watch on her leg.” The model also makes some more general remarks allowing for an even stronger and more interesting linkage of these images. I won’t reproduce them here, because very soon the model will likely formulate such things much better, but I do want to emphasize that, in my view, it managed to find a very promising pair for intertextual study. That same Asya is compared with the hero of another story: “Prodavets dobra” (*A Vendor of Goodness*) by Buida. In full accord with the texts, the model notes that in both stories the mad protagonists ultimately engage in bringing “goodness” to people (the model explicitly states that Buida’s hero distributes “goodness” to people in the literal sense). In my view, this is an example of the model’s brilliant work: it connected not just anything, but aspects that claim to represent the main point of both stories.

An interesting comparison is drawn between *A Demonic Woman* and Zoshchenko’s *Aristokratka* (*The Aristocrat*): “— Selyodka? Yes, yes, yes, give me some herring, I want to eat herring, I want, I want. Is that onion? Yes, yes, give me some onion, give me plenty of everything, everything, herring, onion, I want to eat, I want vulgarities, hurry up… more… more, look, everyone… I’m eating herring!” (*A Demonic Woman*); “She ate some with cream, gobbled down another dish. … And took a third one. … Then a fourth.” (*The Aristocrat*). Another example of a brilliantly discovered link: “An old man, upon seeing the little girl, stopped. Katya decided to ask him: ‘Excuse me, please, how do I get to Bethlehem?’” (*Child and Madman* by Bryusov); “The young man dusted off his trousers with his gloves and delicately asked: ‘Excuse me, grandfather, how do I get to heaven?’” (*The Young Man Who Astonished the Watchman* by Kharms).

The final sentence of Turgenev’s *A Drop of Life* is: “It was not for nothing that this boy swallowed that drop—he came to know all that is available to human understanding, he penetrated the mysteries of the human organism, and he not only cured his parents—he became mighty, wealthy, and his fame spread far throughout the world.” Something similar happens to the hero of Grin’s *The Green Lamp*: once homeless, he masters the sciences and becomes a doctor, a surgeon. The model also reasonably compares *A Drop of Life* with Bryusov’s *Child and Madman*: at the center of both texts are children who (actively) strive to save their parents.

The model noted significant connections between Aleksey Tolstoy’s *Tayna siya velika est* (“This Mystery is Great”) and Kuprin’s *Stronger than Death.* In both texts, the beloved of the hero (a former beloved, in Kuprin’s case) dies (in one instance “toward evening,” in the other “by night”), and her spirit appears to the hero (possibly a vision, possibly not) at night: “A white, airy Nadenka flew into the dark room, swiftly lay down beside Zabelin on his bed, grabbed him with cold hands and began to rend his chest, so that, sparing him further torment, she might tear out his heart” (*Tayna siya velika est*); “And suddenly, opening his eyes and as if awakening from a momentary half-doze, he saw her before him, sitting on the sofa … She sorrowfully shook her head and instantly dissolved, melted away, like the pre-dawn mist” (*Stronger than Death*). That same story by Aleksey Tolstoy is also compared with Bunin’s *Cold Autumn*: in both texts there is the theme of beloveds meeting again after death. To add: this is in fact the main theme of both texts. Observe their endings: “And Zabelin, blinded, transfixed by the light that drowned everything around him, pressed himself to her face and said: ‘We are in Paradise!’” (*Tayna siya velika est*); “And I believe, fervently believe, that somewhere out there he is waiting for me—with the same love and youth as on that evening. ‘You live on, rejoice in the world, then come to me…’ I have lived, I have rejoiced; now the moment is near when I will come” (*Cold Autumn*).

When comparing Bunin’s *Kostsy* (“Mowers”) with Vizbor’s *The Gift*, the model quite accurately notes how these texts are united by the themes of nostalgia, irretrievable past, and the importance of songs. “That was long ago, infinitely long ago, because that life we all lived back then will never return. … none of us will ever forget that pre-evening hour, nor ever fully comprehend, and above all never adequately express, what such uncanny charm there was in their song. … Where else lay the enchantment of that song, its indelible joy, for all its air of hopelessness?” (*Mowers*); “In that evening there was no student in the whole country happier than us. … now we rarely meet—good if once a year. All that remains of our trip to Udmurtia are memories and a song” (*The Gift*). These are just a few quotes; I note that the model often succeeds in catching and comparing the overall tonalities of texts quite deftly. Also recall that the model did not know that the author of one of the texts is a prominent bard.

The model finds an interesting non-trivial connection between Anna Starobinets’ *Ya zhdu* (“I’m Waiting”) and Zakhar Prilepin’s *Dochka* (“Daughter”). In both texts, there is an unexpected attitude of the main character toward someone/something as if it were a daughter. In *Daughter*, nearly the entire text is built around the narrator’s argument that a man should treat his wife like a daughter. In *I’m Waiting*, the main character begins to regard a substance that came from rotten soup essentially as… a daughter. The word “daughter” is not in that story, which makes the model’s find all the more impressive. The story *I’m Waiting* is closely linked with Aleksey Tolstoy’s *The Mermaid.* In both stories, the hero takes care of an unusual female creature (a mermaid in Tolstoy’s text) at home, makes sacrifices for her, becomes fully isolated from others: “I did a great deal for her. Sacrificed a lot. … I phoned my mother and all my acquaintances and asked them never to come by again. I called work and told them I was quitting. Then I cut the telephone cord” (*I’m Waiting*); “I’ll sell the sheep … The old man locked himself up, wouldn’t let anyone into the hut, and prowled around gloomily. … He sold the horse, brought from the town a small trunk of stones” (*The Mermaid*). In the end, the hero of “I’m Waiting” finally goes insane and ends up in an asylum, while the old man is killed by the mermaid.

A strong connection is found between Kuprin’s *Madness* and Oleg Vladimirovich Grigoryev’s *Voroniy glaz* (“Crow’s Eye”). The key events of these texts are the appearance, during a fit of disordered consciousness, of a demonic woman in white: “A woman in a white long dress enters my room … Her face is terrifyingly pale, her long black lashes lowered … yet her lips are exceptionally bright and sensual. The strange woman slowly approaches me, lies down beside me, and embraces me…” (*Madness*); “Gradually, a long white dress emerged into the focus of his vision. Then, likewise, long loose blonde hair over her shoulders, large eyes on a pale face, and thin hands clasped at her breast… She looked at him tenderly, stroking him lightly with her hand” (*Crow’s Eye*). After these encounters, the heroes are shattered and enfeebled. An equally strong connection appears between *Madness* and Glukhovsky’s *Night*. In both works, “Night” drains the hero’s strength like a vampire: “With each kiss she drinks my life… the orgiastic nights little by little deplete my life… … that face with vampire-red lips” (*Madness*); “Night. Night killed my world. She wants to kill me too… Those who have unraveled the vampiric nature of the night and the essence of her mysteries face severe punishment” (*Night*). The heroes inevitably near their end: “How will this end? I have grown weak, my chest aches … Perhaps I will soon die or go mad?” (*Madness*); “But my strength is leaving me … those chasing me … grow ever bolder … the moment of their triumph approaches” (*Night*). Interestingly, in this case, the model performs rather well as a literary scholar, noting that while “there is no direct mention of a woman in the second text, the night is personified and may be associated with a female image,” which only intensifies the connection between the texts (it is important to recall that the model did not know the title of the text—making this all the more remarkable!).

On the one hand, a fairly obvious, but on the other, a rather profound connection was discovered by the model between Dostoevsky’s *The Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree* and Rasputin’s *Mama Went Off Somewhere.* Both texts begin with a little boy waking up, calling out to his mama, but not receiving an answer: “A boy, still very little, maybe six or younger. This boy awoke one morning in a cold, damp basement. … he went up to the bunk bed where his sick mother was lying … maybe for the tenth time he tried to wake up his mama. He was finally seized by horror in the darkness” (*The Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree*); “Mama, I woke up! Nobody replied to him. … ‘… I woke up, and you’re not here.’ … His face tightened in anticipation of an answer, he turned it in all directions, but no answer came, and the little boy began to cry” (*Mama Went Off Somewhere*).

Regarding the texts *A Peaceful War* by Sasha Chorny and *The Dragon* by Zamyatin, the model observes that one of the principal characteristics of the soldier (the main character in both stories, called “the dragon” in Zamyatin’s text) is expressed through his saving of birds.

Now, in my view, some slightly weaker (yet still noteworthy) connections. In *Voroniy glaz* (Grigoryev) and Aleksey Tolstoy’s *The Mermaid*, the main character named Semyon falls under the intoxicating influence of a demonic female being (a mystical female neighbor and a mermaid, respectively). Another Aleksey Tolstoy story, *The Rotten Devil*, also joins this group (see below). In Sasha Chorny’s *A Peaceful War* and Maya Kucherskaya’s *Beauty Will Save the World*, the main characters effectively share the same name (a soldier named Lukashka and Father Luka), and both rescue others. This story of Kucherskaya the model also compares with Chekhov’s *Student*, noting “spiritual transformation through interaction with a religious figure” (in the case of *Student* one would have to make numerous clarifications), and one of the listeners of the student’s sermon is named Lukerya (a parallel to Father Luka in Kucherskaya). In Turgenev’s *A Drop of Life* and Elizarov’s *The Drop*, the pivotal role is played by that very drop that falls from above/the ceiling (though in Turgenev’s text it leads to a miraculous super-knowledge, while in Elizarov’s it leads to death)—let us recall (here it is very important again!) that the model did not know the names of the texts. In the centers of Platonov’s “A Flower on the Ground” and Ulitskaya’s “Grandpa Whisperer,” a child is accompanied by his grandfather/great-grandfather; the model makes fairly precise literary-critical comments: “in both texts, old men pass on to children an understanding of the essence of life, both characters are physically almost blind yet spiritually enlightened.” Panteleev’s *Nastenka* the model correlates with Zoshchenko’s *The Aristocrat*: in both, the central focus is the eccentric behavior of a female character in a restaurant/buffet. In Garshin’s *A Very Short Novel* and Gorky’s *Happiness,* the model notes the following parallels: the heroes recall a time when they might have made the women who interest them their wives, but they chose other actions, so those women ended up with other husbands.

I should make an obvious, though apt, remark. There is a relatively limited range of the most common events that can occur in a literary text—for instance, murder of some character. There are even fewer typical age and gender categories, so, for example, a female character over sixty is extremely common. If a character does not have access to professional weapons, an axe is among the most obvious means for a murder. Thus, “the murder of an old woman with an axe” is simply a contamination of three plausible elements (akin to “the death of an old man at the hands of a magical being”), but thanks to the enormous influence of *Crime and Punishment*, such an intertextual connection is practically doomed to seem very strong. The connections from the paragraph above are good examples of how a connection’s significance strongly depends on the importance (for our context) of the corresponding texts: if these texts matter to us, such connections immediately become very interesting.

Here are a few more connections worth mentioning. In Dostoevsky’s *The Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree* and Kuprin’s *A Fairy Tale*, an extremely important role is played by people’s unwillingness to help those who are in desperate need (a matter of life and death), against the backdrop of a cold winter’s night. In Turgenev’s *The Old Woman* and Mamleev’s *The Eternal Feminine*, the key figure is a “predatory” toothless old woman, the symbol of inevitable death. In Vasily Grossman’s *The Resident* and Solzhenitsyn’s *We Will Not Die, Will We?*, the emphasis is on how quickly the dead are forgotten, on the lack of proper respect and remembrance for them. Both Karamzin’s *Sierra-Morena* and Sorokin’s *Love* revolve around the plot of tragic love leading to deaths (suicides, murder), accompanied by idealization. “Here, my dears, and you go on saying—Beatrice, Beatrice” (the ending of *Love*). Although the short story “In the Bathhouse” by Mamleev and “Life is Joyful” by Elizarov do not, in general, have any exact matches, the model still manages to establish (a profound) connection between these related authors, to quote: “The similarity of the characters’ names (Katya), parallel situations connected with perverse childbearing, death, and grotesque imagery, make the bond between the texts quite specific.”

Machine-based searches for intertextual connections among texts by the same author are less relevant to us: when studying a given author, a specialist already concentrates on his or her entire corpus. However, our current goal, I recall, is to demonstrate the model’s capabilities—and in this context, the skill with which it locates these same-author connections is also quite interesting. Yes, such invariants of the author may be trivial for specialists, but once the model is able to find them (without knowing the texts or the author’s name or the titles), an analogous operation in comparing texts by different authors could yield a genuinely valuable discovery.

First, let me present, in my view, the strongest connections found among texts by the same author. In Platonov’s short stories “A Flower on the Ground” and “An Unknown Flower,” the model clearly highlights the main theme: a laboring flower struggling against death for life in unfavorable conditions (recall that the model did not know the titles, and in the first story the flower does not appear all that frequently). The model provides excellent quotations: “This flower is the most sacred laborer, he works up life from death” (*A Flower on the Ground*); “He labored day and night, so that he might live and not die” (*An Unknown Flower*), and so on. In both stories, children use this flower to learn something very important about life. On Kharms’ *Pakin and Rakukin* and *The Young Man Who Astonished the Watchman*, the model notes their absurdity, surrealism, and a certain otherworldly parallel: the little malicious soul of Rakukin crawls out of his body; the young man who asked how to get to heaven disappears... The model also compares Pakin with the watchman.

The other discovered same-author connections are less strong, though that does not negate the model’s good work. In Chekhov’s “Chameleon” and “The Death of a Government Clerk,” the focal point is fear of a general: Zhigalov in the first case, Brizzhalov in the second. And Chekhov’s “Chameleon” and “Fat and Thin” are paired because in both cases the contrast in a character’s behavior is stressed, depending on whether they are dealing with a higher rank. The model points to a tight link between Dostoevsky’s “The Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree” and “Two Suicides.” Both feature the deaths of young people caused by poverty; in one text the boy sees “Christ’s Christmas tree” before dying, in the other it refers to a girl’s suicide with an icon in her hands; the model mentions a stylistic closeness, the theme of meekness and humility, and a similar reflexive character of the author. The model notes an interconnection between Zoshchenko’s “Nervous People” and “The Bathhouse”: a shared style (it points out the use in both texts of the specific word “tepericha,” a folksy form of “now”), as well as conflicts arising from trivial household items (the pot-scrubbing brush for cleaning a primus stove in a communal kitchen, and washbasins in a public bathhouse). The model speaks of a strong link between Aleksey Tolstoy’s “The Rotten Devil” and “The Mermaid”: in both texts the hero encounters a devilish being (a talking goat and a mermaid, i.e. a half-fish who can speak), which in the finale leads to catastrophic consequences. The model sees a strong connection between Mamleev’s “In the Bathhouse” and “The Eternal Feminine”: from an overall perspective (an atmosphere of amorality, self-destruction, total diabolical influence) down to specific details (both texts vividly mention Beatrice in the context of “perverted femininity”—this is the model’s phrasing; in both, at the end, a character devours flesh—of a cat, of a human). The model notes no fewer connections between “In the Bathhouse” and another Mamleev story, “New Manners”: in the first text, a character devours the head of a drenched cat, in the second a character (later compared to an “otherworldly cat”) places a severed head of a guest on the table; both texts are filled with “(beastly) philosophy.” When comparing Kharms’ texts, the model (almost) always notes the absurdity, but it also finds interesting enough parallels. In *Pakin and Rakukin* and *Old Women Falling Out*, the model compares the reactions to death: “‘Yes,’ said Pakin, ‘Rakukin has died.’ Pakin crossed himself and tiptoed out of the room”; “When the sixth old woman fell out, I got tired of watching them, and went to the Maltsev Market, where, they say, someone gave a blind man a knitted shawl.” Between Kharms’ *Pakin and Rakukin* and *The Trunk*, the model sees these connections: in both texts there is an emphasis on the hero’s neck that is on the threshold between life and death (“the neck is blue, simply disgusting”; “a man with a slender neck”); in both, the hero leaves a locked space in a mysterious manner (Rakukin’s soul passes through walls and leaves the room; the hero suddenly sees himself outside the vanished trunk in which he had been lying), and both mention the personification of death (“the angel of death”; the hero arranges a duel between life and death, culminating famously in “So that means life defeated death by some unknown means”).

I want to emphasize: the model not only succeeds in locating and articulating precise parallels but also somehow “senses” deeper similarities, even if it sometimes (for now) cannot articulate them. The model likewise discovered many more pinpoint/weaker connections, but I will only include them in a footnote[^4].

[^4]: In Dovlatov’s *Ariel* and Tatyana Tolstaya’s *On a Linden Leg*, the model highlights the specific use of English words in Russian speech. The same Tolstaya text is compared to Pelevin’s *The GKChP as Tetragrammaton*: in both, there is discourse about the influence of words on reality. It also compares it to Saltykov-Shchedrin’s *The Wise Little Pike*: in both, there is a special role assigned to the word “ukha” (fish soup). In Elizarov’s *Life is Joyful* and Shalamov’s *By Night*, the characters are indifferent to others’ deaths, and if possible, they use them to their advantage. For Kuprin’s *A Fairy Tale* and Kharms’ *Old Women Falling Out*, the model notes how characters ignore tragic events. But it also observes a measure of anxiety or stupor among those ignoring another’s tragedy in *A Fairy Tale*, something it finds similarly in Zamyatin’s *The Australian.* Regarding Garshin’s *The Traveling Frog* and Chekhov’s *The Death of a Government Clerk,* the model, unwittingly comically yet not without some rationale, remarks that the sad/tragic outcome for the protagonists arises from being unable at crucial moments to hold their tongues. Equally amusing is the model’s observation about the same Garshin tale and Sasha Chorny’s *A Peaceful War*: in both, there is a clever repurposing of an ordinary object for a non-trivial solution to a difficult problem (a stick for flying with birds, and the soldiers’ rope-pulling instead of war). On Chekhov’s *Toska* (“Misery”) and Bondarev’s *The Puppy*, the model highlights how a cabman/driver is deeply affected by the death of his son/puppy, yet is psychologically isolated. The same Chekhov story is compared with Yesenin’s *The Homeless Fellow and the Pup*: in both, the protagonist is unnecessary, uninteresting to other people, and the only true friend is an animal. In Bunin’s *Cold Autumn* and Kuprin’s *Stronger than Death*, a parted couple meets or plans to meet in some mystical manner after or during death. Concerning Garshin’s *A Very Short Novel* and Mamleev’s *New Manners*, the model spots the hero losing a leg. About Kuprin’s *A Fairy Tale* and Bryusov’s *Child and Madman,* the model writes that in both, a child at night “picks up on a call for help or a spiritual signal, wants to respond, but the adults suppress this impulse out of fear or indifference.” In both Grin’s *The Green Lamp* and Kuprin’s *Happiness,* a wealthy or royal figure imprisons his victims in an enclosed space, but they become elevated there by the power of reason. In Karamzin’s *Sierra-Morena* and Dovlatov’s *Blues for Natella,* the model sees competition for a beautiful girl and the theme of death by a weapon. In Kharms’ *The Trunk* and Glukhovsky’s *Eight Minutes,* the model notes the struggle between life and death in a locked space, lacking air. The model draws parallels between the mermaid of Aleksey Tolstoy’s *The Mermaid* and the demonic woman from Teffi’s *A Demonic Woman.* *The Mermaid* is also compared with Elizarov’s *The Drop*: in both, a man perishes because of a female character (the mermaid, the wife), death connected with water. The model further compares *The Drop* to Kharms’ *Pakin and Rakukin*—though one can’t say these two have genuine, explicit parallels, yet indeed *The Drop* by Elizarov (formally) has a remarkable amount in common with Kharms’ prose.*

Now we can draw some conclusions from our examination of this corpus of about one hundred relatively short texts. The model found 15 non-trivial, quite interesting connections, plus about the same number that are slightly less interesting, plus around 10 connections among texts by the same author (that number heavily depends on how many authors in the corpus had multiple texts and how many such texts there were), and roughly 20 pinpoint/weaker connections. It must be noted that as the number of texts in a corpus grows, the number of pairs increases according to the so-called quadratic law. That is, if in our corpus of around 100 texts, we got 15–40 connections that interest us, then in a corpus 10 times larger (around 1,000 texts), we can expect not 150–400, but as many as 1,500–4,000 connections.

I must admit that none of the discovered connections impressed me quite as strongly or seemed as interesting as that link mentioned at the very beginning about the inability to count past six. And even that connection could hardly be considered one of the most fascinating in literary studies. But here it must be remembered that we studied a fairly small corpus (roughly 20% shorter than *War and Peace*’s fourth volume) containing many random texts, and it would be strange to expect it to turn up something truly extraordinary.

The goal was to demonstrate the vast possibilities for (machine!) searching of connections. Clearly, there are many ways one can perform such a search. One could look for connections not between random texts, but between texts where we would anticipate finding something that interests us. One could compare texts in different languages—and that, too, has enormous potential. Even philologists typically know only a few languages, whereas the model can, with almost no loss in quality (for widely spoken languages), search for connections between originals rather than translations.

Furthermore, language models can be tuned. One can either specially train a model or provide the existing model with a better-formulated query. If, for instance, a philologist decides that, in listing the connections above, the emphasis is placed incorrectly—that certain connections are interesting and others are not—that is, to a great extent, almost certainly “explainable” to the model. It can be trained to find precisely what *you* need. And over time, models will almost certainly become both significantly better and less expensive. This poses a challenge for the philological community: can it articulate what “non-trivial intertextual connection” means, and will it be willing to use contemporary computational capabilities. Of course, “intertextuality” is not the grail, but we have to begin *somewhere*… Up to now, technology has been used only very weakly in literary studies.

It is important to mention one of the limitations: working with large language models remains comparatively costly. Exactly how and how quickly the cost of using them will decline is impossible to predict. However, even now, if one sets that goal and is prepared to invest the necessary resources, one can process quite large volumes of text.

I will provide a few examples of potential studies. Gather the top 500/1,000/5,000 major literary texts and find all the connections among them. This would require large computational expenditures, but the research could be done once (and then the obtained results could be actively used). One could conduct a far less resource-intensive study: take several (possibly lengthy) works and look for connections only among fragments of texts by different authors. Or take a few texts of interest to us and find all the connections between these texts and some selected corpus (say, find the connections of Kharms’ *The Old Woman* and *Incidents* with the complete works of Kafka, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett). In the future, one might consider some general database with an interactive map of connections. For a given text, the system would display all the connections it knows. The descriptions of connections could be improved by authorized users (there are plenty of examples where a horizontal digital community has elevated the level of a project to great heights). It would also make sense to add a variety of user assessments of these connections, so that in the case of a large number of them, one could quickly see the most significant.

We hope that powerful, convenient tools for serious textual analysis will appear in the foreseeable future. But (for now) no one will do it for us.
